# Conference Central
Conference Central webapp project to practice Google AppEngine, Python, AngularJS

You can simply access [here](https://conference-central-1226.appspot.com) and test it.


## Requirement
The following needs to be installed first:

- [Python 2.7.x or higher](http://python.org)
- [Google App Engine SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python) with command-line interface tools installed option


## Setup Instructions
1. Update the value of `application` in `app.yaml` to the app ID you
   have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host
   your instance of this sample.
1. Update the values at the top of `settings.py` to
   reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
   [Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com).
1. Update the value of CLIENT_ID in `static/js/app.js` to the Web client ID
1. (Optional) Mark the configuration files as unchanged as follows:
   `$ git update-index --assume-unchanged app.yaml settings.py static/js/app.js`
1. Run the app with the devserver using `dev_appserver.py DIR`, and ensure it's running by visiting your local server's address (by default [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).)
1. (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with [the endpoints tool](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/endpoints/endpoints_tool).
1. Deploy your application.


## Design Choices - Session and Speaker Implementation
**Session** functionality is organized by the following classes:

* Session(ndb.Model): NDB kind that will be saved in Google Datastore
    * name = ndb.StringProperty(required=True)
    * highlights = ndb.StringProperty()
    * speaker = ndb.StringProperty()        **speaker is simply implemented as String property.**
    * duration = ndb.IntegerProperty()
    * typeOfSession = ndb.StringProperty(repeated=True)
    * date = ndb.DateProperty()
    * startTime = ndb.TimeProperty()
    * conferenceId = ndb.StringProperty()

* SessionForm(messages.Message): Session outbound form message managed as view
    * name = messages.StringField(1)
    * highlights = messages.StringField(2)
    * speaker = messages.StringField(3)
    * duration = messages.IntegerField(4, variant=messages.Variant.INT32)
    * typeOfSession = messages.StringField(5, repeated=True)
    * date = messages.StringField(6)  **will be saved as DateProperty on Datastore**
    * startTime = messages.StringField(7)   **will be saved as TimeProperty on Datastore**
    * conferenceId = messages.StringField(8)    **parent conference ID**
    * websafeKey = messages.StringField(9)  **websafeKey for URL presentation**
    * conferenceDisplayName = messages.StringField(10)

* SessionForms(messages.Message): Set of session messages for view
    * items = messages.MessageField(SessionForm, 1, repeated=True)

**Speaker** is simply implemented as String property of Session kind.


## Additional Queries
* getSessionsByKey
    * get a session info by websafe session key
    * http_method='GET'
    * path='session/{SessionKey}'
    * {SessionKey} - websafe session key
    
* getSessionsByDuration
    * get sessions by duration range
    * http_method='GET'
    * path='sessionsByDuration/{duration}'
    * {duration} - range of duration; format "{minimum minutes}_{maximum minutes}"


## Query Problem
> Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm? What is the problem for implementing this query? What ways to solve it did you think of?

To get the result sessions, It needs two inequality filter for `typeOfSession`(!=) and `startTime`-`duration`(<). Inequality filters for *only one property* per query is supported, so this query is unable to be implemented.

**Solution**

1. Get the query result1 for `typeOfSession` != 'workshop'
1. Get the query result2 for `startTime`-`duration` < 17:00
1. Compare `websafeKey` of each session in both results, and get the sessions that the same `websafeKey`s are existed in both results.
